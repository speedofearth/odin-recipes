    <h1>Chimichurri Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Cimichurri chicken tenders for a crowd cook up quickly in the oven, with
      fresh, herby flavor from chimichurri. Make the chimichurri sauce the day
      before, if you like, and simply refrigerate in a sealed container until
      you are ready to bake. We like this with Mexican rice, black beans, and a
      simple green salad.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup packed fresh parsley leaves</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped green onion (including green tops)</li>
      <li>1 jalapeño pepper, seeds and membranes removed, diced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 pounds chicken tenders</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12x18-inch
        sheet pan with parchment or aluminum foil; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine parsley, oregano, garlic, green onions, and jalapeño in the bowl
        of a food processor. Pulse just a few times to break up the parsley and
        combine the ingredients. Place processed vegetables in a small bowl;
        stir in vinegar, lemon juice, and olive oil. Season with salt and black
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken tenders in a single layer on the prepared pan. Lightly
        season with salt and pepper; sprinkle smoked paprika evenly over the
        tenders. Spoon half of the chimichurri evenly over the tenders. Reserve
        remaining half of chimichurri, covered, in the refrigerator to use
        later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center
        and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees
        C).
      </li>
